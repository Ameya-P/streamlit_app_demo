st.markdown(":blue[Berkeley Carbon Trading Project's] Voluntary Registry Offsets Database contains all carbon offset projects listed globally by four major voluntary offset project registries: American Carbon Registry (ACR), Climate Action Reserve (CAR), Gold Standard, and Verra (VCS). These four registries generate almost all of the world's voluntary market offsets and include projects eligible for use under the California, Quebec, and Washington lcap-and-trade programs as well as UN Clean Development Mechanism projects that transitioned into one of the voluntary registries.")

**Main types of project documents:**

* **Project Listing Document** - indicates the intent to register a project under a registry and contains a draft of information in the PDD.
* **Project Design Document (PDD) / Project Description / Initial OPDR** - describes the project and its history, how it meets the eligibility requirements of the methodology, the calculations that will be used to estimate emissions reductions including definition of the baseline and the monitoring plan. Follows the requirements of the particular methodology and can have appendixes.
* **Validation Report** - approved third-party verifiers certify that the project meets the eligibility requirements of the methodology, and that the emissions/removals calculation and monitoring plan meet the requirements of the methodology. Sometimes, validation is performed in combination with the first verification.
* **Monitoring Report (also called OPDR)** - presents all monitored data and emission reduction/removals calculations on which credits are issued (often annually).
* **Verification Report** - third-party verifiers review the monitoring report, verifying that the data and calculations are correct and follow the requirements of the methodology. Registries issue credits based on the monitoring and verification reports. Verification reports can include project descriptions and other project details.
* **Methodology (also called Protocol)** - defines the eligibility, emissions calculations, and monitoring requirements for specific project types to generate offset credits.
