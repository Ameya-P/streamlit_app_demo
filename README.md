Notes:

Using the streamlit library: https://docs.streamlit.io/

I had to use Git Large File Storage to host our data since its larger than 100 Mb:

Update: This isn't necessary. Our file wasn't actually that big. There was some sort of error when turning it into a csv that made the file size balloon up.
